# Huffman Coding Compression (Python)

A simple **Huffman Coding based File Compression & Decompression** project built in **Python**.

This project compresses a `.txt` file into a `.bin` file using **Huffman Encoding**, and then decompresses it back to the original text.

## ✨ Features

✅ Compress any `.txt` file into a binary `.bin` file  
✅ Decompress the `.bin` file back into readable text  
✅ Lossless compression (original content is fully restored)  
✅ Simple and beginner-friendly code structure  
✅ Uses **Heap / Priority Queue** (`heapq`) for efficient encoding
